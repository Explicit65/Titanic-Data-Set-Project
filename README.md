# Titanic-Data-Set-Project
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on predicting passenger survival using various machine learning models. 
Data Exploration: Initial data exploration and preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
Model Building: Implementation of multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost and CatBoost to predict survival outcomes.
Model Evaluation: Detailed evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall.
Deployment: Deployed on FastAPI and returned a JSON response of the predicted survivals.
